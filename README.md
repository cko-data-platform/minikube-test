## Instructions
This repository contains two main elements designed to assess your skills in Terraform and Kubernetes. Each section of the test is structured to evaluate specific competencies in these technologies. Below, you'll find an overview of the test, including instructions, assessment criteria and time allocations.

## Test Overview
This technical test is divided into two parts:

1. Kubernetes-based Assessment
2. Terraform-based Assessment

Each part is designed to be completed within 45 minutes. Including setup and any additional discussion, the entire interview process will take approximately 2 hours.

## Assessment Objectives
### Kubernetes-based Assessment: 
This section tests your proficiency with Kubernetes. You will be assessed on your knowledge of Kubernetes resources, local deployment and general troubleshooting.
